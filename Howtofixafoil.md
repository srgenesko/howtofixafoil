A foil is a particular style of fencing blade, meant to be used in a jabbing fashion in the sport of fencing. In a tournament setting, foil blades are wired into a sensor to keep track of the score of the match, and therefore, can be relativley expensive. As these blades tend to take copious amounts of physical abuse, they are very prone to breaking. Thus, it becomes neccesary to replace the blade in order to continue with a match. 


## Needed Components/Hardware

In order to properly replace the blade of a foil weapon, there a few required pieces of hardware:

- A new foil blade, electric if required
- The original broken blade with accompanying gaurd and handle
- A set of alan keys
- A clean and safe workspace



## Blade Replacement

Ensuring a safe work environment is used or provided, begin the replacement by either placing the foil on the table with the grip over the edge, or vertically with the blade lightly clamped within a vice. Using the alan key, begin loosening the screw fastening the blade on to the handle. Once removed, store in a safe space so as not to lose the hardware. With the grip loose, it is now possible to remove it along with the guard from the blade. To do so, simply remove the grip carefully, taking care not to damage the wires attached to the blade, along with the soft piece on the back of he guard. Now the foil should be in three distinct pieces, the grip, the guard, and the broken blade. Be cautious handling the broken blade as it can be sharp! The next step is to take the new foil blade, and thread the wires through the guard. There should be a small notch in the guard, this corresponds to a small protrusion on the blade. Make sure the blade fits snugly into the guard, then place the soft piece back onto the guard. Attach the grip onto the base of the new blade, again ensuring a tight fit. Using the alan key, reattach the screw onto the grip, making sure the entire weapon is tight and secure. You're foil is now ready to be used in competition.
